Just a fun little to-do list project that suits my needs.

Some ideas for the app:

      -Live update on my personal to-do list on that day and real-time update a task as "done" as i finish without me updating it on server.

      -showcase my project i finished with preview images (clickable to that project link)

      -Auto updates on the website for any project i finished and deployed (will need to look into the related APIs later)

      -Possibly train a custom AI personal assistent with knowledge of all the projects i have done (later feature)

      -Powered by MongoDB Atlas(Because i will be using it to do various unrelated functions, so Non-relational   database is better for this need)
            -P.S i will keep it local for now until the project is ready
